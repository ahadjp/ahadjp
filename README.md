### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Md Abdul Ahad,
#### strong passion for technology

Currently residing and working in Japan, with a strong passion for technology and a clear goal of establishing a career as a full-stack engineer within the Japanese IT industry.
My journey in information technology began in Bangladesh, where I studied at a specialized IT training center and gained foundational knowledge in web design and development. During this time, I also acquired hands-on experience through a part-time role at an IT company, where I worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, hardware repair, and OS installation.
Although I am presently employed in the service industry, I remain deeply committed to my professional growth in tech. I actively enhance my technical skill set through self-paced online courses on platforms such as Udemy and engage in regular coding practice to stay current with industry standards.
While I have not yet held a professional IT position in Japan, I am an entry-level candidate with a strong work ethic, adaptability, and a fast-learning mindset. I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to a development team and thrive in a collaborative, forward-thinking environment. Additionally, my proficiency in both Japanese and English, along with my cultural understanding, allows me to integrate smoothly into diverse work settings.

Skills: HTML / CSS/JS/PYTHON
